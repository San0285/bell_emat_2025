    "World of Warcraft is an MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) that is in it's 21st year since it's release on November 23rd, 2004. Since then, World of Warcraft has launced 10 expansions, and all of these expansions have been met with a surge of community excitement, speculation and online activity. Players and content creators response to expansion reveals, cinematics, and feature announcements create hype across all social media platforms. With the upcoming release of their eleventh expansion, Midnight, in Spring of 2026, there has been a lot of buzz online, particularly due to the newest feature, player housing. My motivation for this researh is to explore the following question: </br>\n",

    "Through my analysis I got clear insight into patterns of online engagement, but there were some limitations that shaped the results. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Google Trends* values are relative and not absolute. Trends platform scales from 0-100 based on the highest search volume within a certain timeframe. This means that the 100 for Dragonflight doesn't indicate the same number of searches for Midnight's 100. Since each keyword is measured against itself that limits the volume comparison across the three expansions. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*YouTube* results were only based on 20 videos per expansion, to make the comparison even between the three. But that was only a small fraction of the videos, and the ones that were displayed were probably top ranked videos, this makes the dataset bias towards the top-performing content creators and official cinemetic releases. So the total and median view numbers may underrepresent smaller creator or regional content that could give us more insight into community engagement.</br> \n",
    "\n",
    "*Midnight* hasn't launched yet, so the data is still developing. Blizzard also hasn't hit some of its major marketing points- beta testing, launch trailers, and expansion guides. So the lower total view count and median performance should not be interpreted as a lack of interest, but rather as a look at Midnights early in its hype cycle. If I could have collected this data after its launch early 2026 I would have gotten a better comparison.</br> \n",
    "\n",
    "The engagement metrics don't directly reflect the players satisfaction or in-game behavior. The high searh interest or YouTube views may indicate curiosity, excitement, or controversy, but they don't reveal whether players are enjoying the expansion, purchasing or subscribing to the game, or if they are continuing to play it long-term.</br>\n",

    "- Comparing World of Warcrafs hype cylcles with other MMORPGs such as Final Fantasy XIV, Guild Wars 2, or Elder Scrolls Online.

Doing a cross-game comparison could help determine whether WoW's patterns are unique or part of a broader industry trend. </br>\n",

This is a cycle that games have been going through for decades, but it was fun to compare expansions I have played through, to get a different view of how the player community engaged with each one.
